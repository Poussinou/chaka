## New Features
- <img src="resources/flip_vertical.png"> Vertical Flipping

  In **Vertical Flipping** mode, a page can stay at any position by finger moving. So you can move half page and stay there.

- <img src="resources/text_left.png"> Right-to-Left Forward

  In general, words read from left to right (right to left for Right-to-Left text such as Arabic), lines top to down, page left to right. But there are some Japanese and traditional Chinese books, where words read from top to down, lines right to left, page right to left. **Right-to-Left Forward** mode can be applied to these books.

  In **Right-to-Left Forward** mode, a page can stay at any position by finger moving. So you can move half page and stay there.

- <img src="resources/single_column.png"> Single Column

  Some PDF books were scanned in a way that the left and right printing page were put into one image. In this situation, **Single Column** mode plays a role. It splits a dual-spread page of a PDF book into two pages.

  **Single Column** mode works on **WIDE** documents that page width is longer than page height. In this mode, all pages except first and last page are splitted.

- <img src="resources/focus.png"> Focus

  In **Focus** mode, a page will retent the position of last page on navigation. For PDF books that has much page margins, this mode will save you many unnecessary finger taps while you are reading.

  When entering **Focus** mode, current page will zoom automatically to fill screen in shorter dimension and center in screen. Most books will gain the best fit of reading window.

- <img src="resources/smart_focus.png"> Smart Focus

  In many scanned books, content area do not always appear centered in a page. It often near a border aside, left or right. For example, it may near right border in even page, left border in odd page, or vice versa. **Smart Focus** deals with this case. By adjusting position of even or odd pages accordingly, it makes **Focus** mode behave smartly. **Smart Focus** must work with **Focus** mode to make sense.

- All above modes can work simultaneously. There is no exclusion.

- Current size indication in **Font Size** menu

  **Font Size** button will appear if the document is flowable, e.g. epub.

- Collapsing and expanding of **Table of Contents** headings

  **Table of Contents** button will appear if the document has an ToC.

- Scrollable Toobar
