## New Features
- <img src="resources/flip_vertical.png"> Vertical Flipping

  The most popular reading mode.

- <img src="resources/text_left.png"> Right-to-Left Forward

  In general, words in a book read from left to right (right to left for RtL text such as Arabic), lines top to down, page left to right. There is an exception in some Japanese and traditional Chinese books, where words read from top to down, lines right to left, page right to left. **Right-to-Left Forward** mode can be applied to these books.

- <img src="resources/single_column.png"> Single Column

  Some PDF books were scanned in a way that the left and right pages were put into one image, resulted a so called dual-spread page. For this situation, **Single Column** mode plays a role. It splits a dual-spread page of a PDF book into two pages.

  In **Single Column** mode, all pages except first and last page are splitted. And note that it works only with **WIDE** documents that page width is longer than page height.

- <img src="resources/focus.png"> Focus

  **Focus** mode can retent the position of last page. If you flip or jump to another page. it will show the area of new page the same as old page. For PDF books that has much page margins and it is zoomed, this mode can save many unnecessary finger taps while you are reading.

  On entering **Focus** mode, current page will zoom automatically to fill screen in shorter dimension and center in screen. Most books will gain the best fit of reading window.

- <img src="resources/smart_focus.png"> Smart Focus

  In many scanned books, content area do not always appear centered in a page. Frequently it inclines toward left or right border. **Smart Focus** deals with this case. By adjusting the position of even or odd pages accordingly, it makes **Focus** mode behave smartly.

  **Smart Focus** must work with **Focus** mode to make sense.

- Continuous scrolling

  Continuous scrolling is a more charming feature for book reading experience. Instead of changing to prev or next page at one tap, it can scroll across several pages freely and quickly, in both horizontal and vertical flipping mode. It can also scroll to and stay at any position of a page, or slide automatically to the nearest whole page, according to current working status.

- <img src="resources/format.png"> Font size

  Current font size is indicated in **Font Size** menu. The **Font Size** button will appear if the document is flowable, e.g. epub.

- <img src="resources/toc.png"> Table of Contents

  **Table of Contents** support multi-level headings, and headings collapsing and expanding. The **Table of Contents** button will appear if the document has an ToC.

- Scrollable Toobar

  The top toolbar is made scrollable to accommodate more buttons.
